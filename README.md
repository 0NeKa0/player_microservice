# Player Microservice Assignment - Netta Kaufman
Home assignment for Backend Developer 2 at Intuit :)
First of all, I want to thank you for this amazing opprotunity. 
I tried to do my best accourding to time limits, though I know I didn't cover everything I wanted to.
After implementing the basic approuch I thought to add a `h2` in-memory database to improve it, but decided to spend the rest of the time in making the current code as clean as possible. 

In case I had some more time, I would defenitly: 
- Create a database to store the players after reading the csv, and request the data from the db.
- Make sure cases like: very large files, file data that changes etc. are covered.
- Check options of saving the data in cload storages. 
- Add integrations tests
- Have some more fun investigating and improving the app.

  I thank you again for your time, and look forward meeting you!
  Netta
